All you can eat fish fry for $11.75! Of course Friday night. NICE Um yeah... lots of seating, TV's and Fish fry? you CANNOT beat it... This place is great! (Bit of a drive from downtown madison) but isnt that what Yelp is all about? Seriously, cheap food, cheap drinks. And PLENTY of it... plus this place has been around for quite a while! (longer than people might think)
