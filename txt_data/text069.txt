Location, location, location.  Great place in downtown Middleton.  Close to all of the places you just need to visit, such as the Mustard Museum (yes, you need to go there), Hubbard St. Diner (try the pies or the carrot cake), and definitely go to the live band at the Capital Brewery a block away on Friday night.  Fantastic place to walk and just enjoy the ambiance of a great little town.  Oh, and free breakfast, free food and drinks on Tues-Thurs, free morning newspapers and spacious suites are all wonderful.
