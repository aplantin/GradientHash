A really lovely surprise on a rather horrific family road trip. We were greeted at the door, the waitress was a peach, and the nice man who filled water/helped out was the sweetest guy ever. The food is also great if you're a fan of the diner-type grub; my hot turkey sandwich will live on in my dreams. You can definitely tell the place has the old time appeal of a great family place as all the locals (mostly older people) know each other and it's clear it's the happening place for breakfast with the over-60 crowd (but hey, that says the food has to be pretty homestyle and tasty to me.)  If you're headed down 94 and need a good lunch stop, make this it.
