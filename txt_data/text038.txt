Don't have time and/or cute outfits for Madison but want an alternative to Cracker Barrel? This is your stop. I started with the chicken dumpling soup. Simply divine, so much as to seriously tempt my veg accomplice. Cheese curds were another hit, far superior to those from the state fair.  Wraps, sammys, even the fried mushrooms were consistent, wholesome, and fresh. Service was on point, our waitress Brianna was business pro.  People watching was a little poor(s), to be expected in rural Midwest? I think our impassioned debate over drug use might have startled the crowd. Nonetheless, not a Cracker Barrel. Takes Amex.
