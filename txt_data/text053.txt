Next to Chick-Fil-A, Culver's is my fav fast food chain.  Rarely is a snowboarding trip complete without Culver's to top off the day. The butter burgers hit the spot (though mine was heavy on the red onions; good thing those are easily removeable), and the fried cheese curds are to die for.  You don't find those floating around just anywhere.  But if there is anything you MUST get, it's a cup of the frozen custard.  Damn, that's good stuff.
