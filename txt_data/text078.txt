Okay, sorry guys..but I was NOT impressed. Just happened to be in the neighborhood...so I decided to go to Chin's because I could sit outside. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the fried rice. The meat in the wraps was sub-standard and reminded me of dog food. The sauce was pretty much the only good part. The fried rice was described to have veggies and shrimp and crab...when it came out, it was so obviously KRAB. Ugh. I won't be wasting my money again.
