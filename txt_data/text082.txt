Great neighborhood bar! There definitely isn't anything 'special' on tap here, but sometimes all you need is a PBR tallboy to quench your thirst! I don't come for the drinks anyway- the burgers are delicious! The local Knoche's beef and fluffy, buttery buns are SO GOOD. \nAnd this is the place to come for your no-frills all-you-can-eat Friday night fish fry! You're served a dinner roll, coleslaw and potato (I always order hashbrowns!) and a choice between fried cod or perch or baked cod. Do yourself a favor and order at least one round of the baked cod! It absolutely melts in your mouth!
