My meaty goodness...why isn't Culvers a nationwide chain?  This bacon cheese burger is way too good to come out of a fastfood drive through window.  I had a nice little picnic on the tailgate of my pickup (driving cross country....long story).  I could not believe how great this burger was.  The amazing part is the onion rings might be better than the burger. If you're passing through Wisconsin, you need to stop at Culvers.
