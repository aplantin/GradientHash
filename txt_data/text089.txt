ONLY TAKES CASH OR CHECK!!!  So, this is not always a deal breaker, and I have been here before and went out of my way to return. I didn't either remember this rule, or it changed since I last visited, since I usually don't carry either. They won't pay the fee for the credit card machine, but want me to dish out money for checks or ATM fees...makes me mad on principle. And there is a Starbucks literally across the street or other local joints that will gladly take my debit/credit cards down the a little ways away that I will now know to frequent instead.
