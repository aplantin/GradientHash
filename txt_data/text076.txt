Chin's is my go-to "fast food" stop in my neighborhood. I fell in love with Chin's when I was living across the street from their downtown location.  I usually go with a selection from the kid's menu, the Smiling Lotus Plate. A battered chicken breast with your choice of sauce (lemon, sweet & sour, and teriyaki - though I'm sure you can pick any sauce, these are just the kid-friendly flavors), choice of rice (white or brown), two cream cheese puffs, a chocolate-coated fortune cookie, and soda or milk, all for $4.17 including tax.  The SLP is by far the best deal around for my thrifty needs. The adult entrees cost twice as much, and though they offer more meat, they do not include any of the other goodies. One chicken breast is plenty for me.   Despite being inexpensive, the chicken is fairly good quality - I've never had any gross bits (like the weird slimy string you find in chicken tenders at a lot of places). Occasionally the rice is on the dry side, but that's why man invented sauce.  Though 9 times out of 10 I opt for the Smiling Lotus Plate (with lemon sauce & white rice, if you're wondering), occasionally I'll get the Sesame Chicken. Lots of chicken, plenty of rice, two meals easy.
