I like this location better than the one near Johnson's creek.  It is a bit tight when you walk in, but the charm soon takes over.  \n\nI was not really impressed by the food.  However, their pastries won my over.  Try it all!  The pie was delicious.  I went with a simple apple selection.  Delicious, perfection.  It is nothing crazy, no fancy name but truthfully one of the best piece of classic apple you can find around here.  The service is a little slow but once again, it is a small restaurant with lots of charm.  You get what you get and I love it.  It is near a Christmas tree farm so it is the perfect place to stop and get some cocoa on your way.
