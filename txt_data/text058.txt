Well, it's a Michaels. Nothing particularly special there. Normally, I'd give most Mic haels stores 4stars, but this one tends to be a bit messy and has the wonkiest layout of any craft store. Also, if you pop in and don't find what you're looking for, you have to loop through ALL the checkouts to exit (not just pass by one like at most similar stores). This makes me feel a bit uncomfortable if they happen to not have what I'm looking for or if I just stop in to price something, etc.   Overall, a decent place. Greenway Station on the whole is a bit of a weird shopping center, but I do love that a craft store is in the mix.
