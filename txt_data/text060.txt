Never again will I shop this store!  I have been an extremely loyal customer for well over 5 years.  Several weeks ago I made a very large purchase of many items in order to make a scrapbook for my daughter's bridal shower.  During the course of that shopping experience, an associate kindly offered to keep my selections at the checkout desk while I continued to shop; however, inadvertently another associate also added another customer's purchases to my pile as well, which I did not discover until a few days ago when I proceeded to put together the scrapbook.  When I attempted to return about $20 worth of merchandise that I had paid for but had not selected, I was told I was past their 30-day policy and I was simply out of luck. I later discovered, however, that I had returned these items WITHOUT a receipt, I would have been given a store credit--which I had expressly requested but been denied because I was careful enough to save my receipt!  Nope...no more of my business and I'm telling my story to every woman I know!
