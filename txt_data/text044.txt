My arch-enemy. I've never encountered a company with such an astounding lack of customer service.  Their monopoly on the local market doesn't help either. UPDATE: after posting this review, a customer service rep contacted me regarding my problem.  I had a rather pleasant email exchange with the reps.  We still weren't able to correct my problem but for finding an employee that was willing to go above and beyond, they gain an extra star.
