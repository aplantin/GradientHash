Went here for lunch with two co-workers, checked Yelp before we went and the reviews were very positive so we decided to give it a try. Yikes! How can the reviews be 4-5 stars and the service at best "average", the food was terrible and myself and my co-workers all agreed, this restaurant doesn't rate two stars. I had one of the special Friday offerings, Smelt. It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt. After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders. I looked at my plate and was shocked! There was 12-15 so-called Smelt about 3" long and deep fried. They looked like little fat cigarettes! I bit into one and it was all batter, I tried another and it was the same. I had deep fried batter for lunch!! I haven't had a meal this bad since I got out of the Navy!  My co-workers meals were not much better, one had Chicken Fried Steak and he said it was made out of the box. My other co-worker had the Cod and he said it was mushy and brown colored! YUK!  I hate to write such a negative review but this restaurant earned "one" star. Maybe they have great breakfast! I hope they do because their lunches are sub-par.  There are other restaurants on this street/highway, I'd give them a try before I stopped here. I know my co-workers and I won't be coming back.
