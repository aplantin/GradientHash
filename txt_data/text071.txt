So I used the \"CHAT ONLINE with an agent\" option today.  You can find this link near the top, right side of the screen on the main Overview page on thier website.  I've used this feature with other organizations in the past - so it wasn't really new for me.  I chatted with Vivian and she answered my quick question about dog fees in a timely manner.  That's all I could ask for.  Thanks Vivian!    Since I wasn't able to find \"Dog Fee\" information on the website, I offer the info here:  \"Pets allowed with nonrefundable fee of 75 USD per stay. No larger than 80 lbs. Pet agreement must be signed at check in. Call hotel for details. Record of complete and up to date vaccinations required.\"  I hope this helps all the dog lovers out there.
