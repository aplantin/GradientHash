I make jewelry...for myself and for others. I am always looking for a great deal on the finest beads and findings.   My first visit to this Michael's came on the day after Thanksgiving. Hell? No really. After elbowing through a few rows of ladies, I reached a mongo wall of strings of beads. Heaven!  They have the best selection I have seen, really, anywhere. There are always coupons to be found...on their website, in the Sunday newspaper, on your door step, or sign up to get them delivered to your mailbox. It makes a major difference on your wallet.   Now that's what I call a finding!
