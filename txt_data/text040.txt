there should be a negative rating on here.  one star is way to high. i am sick and tired of how the cable box is never working their solution? KEEP RESETTING THE BOX... YES IT IS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE I GET MY SERIVCE ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT'S NOT THEIRS TO MAKE SURE IT WORK.  Plus they have poor customer service but I don't blame the people that answer the phones but the people who st the rules to nickel and dime it's customers. charter is horrible and since i coudn't get thru to complain on the phone here is my truth.  Charter is the worst.
