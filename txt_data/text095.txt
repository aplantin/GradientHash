I think this is a good place to come for breakfast or lunch. The food is definitely homemade and tasty. Straightforward and good quality. I've often had the salads featured on their board and have really enjoyed them. Additionally, I've had soups and smoothies - also tasty and homey (in a good way). I would certainly recommend this place. It can get busy. Cash/check only and open until 2.
