May be one of Middleton's best kept secrets... I had run past Paul's on numerous mornings and always figured the illumated "Open" sign was an oversight.  Turns out they really are open at 7am each morning, and that they do indeed serve breakfast, including a prime rib breakfast on Sundays! While I haven't had breakfast from Paul's yet, I can confirm that it smells great!  We did enjoy a few rounds of drinks while at Paul's last night, and really had a good time.  The establishment is smoke-free (a HUGE bonus in our book), and is laid out in such a manner that the place doesn't feel crowded, even when it's busy.  The service was top notch; we never waited or wanted for anything, and we enjoyed watching the cook prepare a wide variety of bar fare with impeccible precision and ease.   The chicken tenders looked amazing, as did the bacon cheeseburgers with grilled onions. Portions were astronomically huge, and the most expensive menu item was $6.75. I can't wait to go there for dinner some night.  We finished our drinks, paid our tab, thanked the staff and headed home. We were thrilled with Paul's and will definitely be back. We'll update with a report on the food quality as well, but I have a feeling that it won't disappoint.  Go here for: drinks, after work gatherings, breakfast, and to enjoy what appears to be excellent "bar food" (burgers, fries, onion rings, chicken tenders, etc).
