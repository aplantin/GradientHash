I came to Madison and tried out this club.  VERY  NICE for the individual price.  A warm pool, lap pool, two hot tubs, cardio/weight room upstairs, weight room downstairs, raquetball courts, you name it.  Had a great workout, and and an awesome protein shake at their smoothy bar on my way out!  Really nice staff too!
