Pricey, but plentiful. Since all the local independent scrapbook stores in the Madison area are now gone this is really the only option for good scrapbook supplies (apart from the small amounts at places like JoAnn's or Michaels) and they have most things you would need.   Recently, I've been in a few times to use their workroom. It's free of charge Sun - Thu and you can have access to their tools and such. The chairs are very comfortable too.   Very friendly staff, though they sometimes get a bit too chatty and aren't anywhere near the register when you need them. If I could improve Archiver's, it would be to have a more attentive staff in regards to sales and more reasonable prices (for a large chain, they have prices on many things that are higher than small stores - bizarre).
