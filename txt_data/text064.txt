This is a well-run club that has seemingly unlimited choices for its members at a very reasonable price. The strength and cardio equipment is modern and always in working condition, and you rarely if ever have to wait for anything. The group fitness options are plentiful and the instructors are engaged and motivating. I don't partake, but there are a ton of yoga, Pilates and Barre offerings in the wellness center across the parking lot from the main facility. The pool areas are clean and well-maintained, and the water in the pools is kept at a comfortable temperature. I've worked out a Harbor for a year now. The club has the appearance of a facility that has expanded multiple times as best it can given the architecture of the building and the space available. It's not easy to navigate as there are many separate rooms, but the staff is friendly and helpful and it's easy enough to figure things out once you get the hang of the layout. I wouldn't mind an update of the facility, but not at the expense of higher prices. It's clean and friendly and doesn't lack options and to me, that's most important.
