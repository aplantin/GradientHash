Pleasant atmosphere, great coffee, hit or miss bakery  When I venture to Middleton to catch up with friends over a cup of coffee, I often end up at the Prairie Cafe & Bakery.  It's a short bike ride from the 53597 and the Alterra Coffee (or is it Colectivo now, I'm so confused) they serve beats the pants off of what you can get from the neighboring Starbucks.    I wish the outdoors seating area took advantage of the nearby Pheasant Branch Conservancy.  Sipping coffee and watching the locals pick-up their dry-cleaning just isn't the vibe I'm looking for I guess.    I can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch selections, since I'm just a coffee and baked goods sort of guy.  As for baked goods, I've had some excellent scones and muffins at Prairie.  Like scream it from the rooftop great.  But not every time.  Just when I'm ready to proclaim Prairie my go to coffee and a scone hangout, I get a scone that's as dry as Atacama Desert.  And since I'm dropping some decent coin here, I want better consistency.  Things I like:  * Love the staff here. Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service.  *  Always love me some free wi--fi.  Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds.  * The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background.  Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates.  * When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line.  There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup.  Things I don't  *The \"cash only\" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now.  Start taking plastic, people.  * The baked goods are not inexpensive.  It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery.  It's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency.
