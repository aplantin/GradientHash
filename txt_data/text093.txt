I had the Tuscan chicken & 3 cheese.  Very yummy and served with a side choice.  I chose the sliced fruit.  I can say it was worth the $10...not for just the food but the ambiance.   I'd come back here to try another hot sandwich.   Just keep in mind, at this moment the cafe is still cash only.  Walk across the street grab yourself some cash and get here for a nice sandwich.
