If you live in Madison, you too probably have a love/hate relationship with Charter.  It's nice to have high speed Internet without having to buy a useless cable package, however it kind of sucks that the service is insanely inconsistent.  As someone who has spent countless hours with customer service representatives ranging from inadequate to empathetic and resourceful, I have no idea where the problem lies with their service.  (a.k.a. why am I not consistently getting the Internet service that I both adore and pay so much for?) However those of us who just want high-speed Internet without phone or cable one just sort of has to suck it up as this is really the only option.
