hands down one of the best breakfasts my wife and i have had. stopped in here based on the positive reviews from fellow yelpers and was sure glad i did. this is a good sized diner at a truck stop. the first thing that caught our eye was the pastries - they were all huge and all looked great. tip - be sure to save space for at least one.  i went with the cinnamon roll french toast and was very pleased. very large portion and great taste - go with the sausage patty over the links. people behind us had links on their plate and they didnt look too appetzing. the patty was good. wife went with a chicken friend steak, eggs, and hashbrowns. hashbrowns left a bit to desire but they get bonus points for being real potatoes and fresh. overall, great experience and we were in and out in 35 mins so we could continue out journey. looking forward to stopping here again sometime soon.
