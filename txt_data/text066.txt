Look, I love this place and I don't want you to join. It's the antithesis of the meat market known as Princeton club.  Sadly, smoothie bar/cafe is gone.   Harbor is a really laid back health club that has everything that I need and more. The only downfalls are that it's super old and kind of put together like a corn maze.  8 years and counting!
