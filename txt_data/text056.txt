My boyfriend and I came here to have breakfast after New Years. We weren't expecting much being not at our best either.  The service, as mentioned several times in yelp, is really slow. My drink was forgotten about and the next time our waitress came around she was serving our meal about 30-40 minutes from taking our order. The restaurant was probably half full of people. My boyfriends meal was mediocre "at best" as he put it but my meal was worse. My bacon and egg omelette was burnt and the cheese was scarce.  At the end of our meal, our server still charged us for the missing drink but they were kind enough to take it off the bill, that is while we waited 10 minutes standing at the register. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant because I think my time is worth more than they treated it but could be nice for those who think differently.
