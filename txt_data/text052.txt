Really good stuff!! The custard was great! I loved it and when I am back in the old USA I can only hope I will cross paths with another culvers. You know what the thing is with culvers? You actually don't need that much, it's sort of like eating cake batter or cookie dough. You can only have so much before you start getting that sickly feeling and start stirring that plastic spoon around and staring down the custard and wondering why you dont wanna finish. Yeah it's custard and it's heavy especially when you add every kind of peanut butter chocolate bar to the mix. Let me tell you those first five spoonfuls are pure goodness then it goes downhill. Less is more with this stuff let me tell you! Next time I am getting the smallest size, and I will be far more pleased and not guilty I threw out a mega size bucket. Hahaha!
