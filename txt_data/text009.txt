Great truck stop restaurant.  I've had breakfast and dinner here and it has always been good.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  The bakery I guess is legendary.  They have doughnuts the size of your head!  Eclairs the size of your arm and Cream Puffs that are about 10\" high.  On our most recent trip in the area, stopped at the gas station attached to the restaurant fo some quick snacks and of course BAKERY. If you are driving by and see the sign for The Pine Cone Restaurant - Take the next off ramp and stop it.
