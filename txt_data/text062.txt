Somehow amid 18 credits both semesters of my senior year, I also managed to find time to do a whole lotta scrapbooking.  And this place pretty much carries everything and anything you need.  Printed papers, solid papers, pens and markers and pencils, stickers, die-cuts, acid-free adhesives, scissors, punches, and a great selection of albums.  I think they have classes, too, but being the *expert* scrapbooker I am (brushes hair off shoulder), I never checked those out though I'm sure they're a lot of fun.  Their workroom is well-stocked, and (*nerd alert!*) it is really fun & satisfying to lock yourself in a space like that with all the necessary tools and make an entire scrapbook in an evening or afternoon.  Middleton is really close to Madison/the UW Campus and convenient to get to.  The store is spacious and well laid-out; really, a photo-fanatic's dream!
