I recommend you stay here if you need a hotel in the area. Comfortable and clean. Stayed here two nights. Breakfast is always really good and really well stocked and FREE. On certain weeknights they serve FREE BEER. FREE BEER.   The service at Staybridge is always stellar and this location did not disappoint. Kenny deserves major props. He was really cool.  Internet worked great (free too) and everything in the room was in working condition and clean.   The sitting area in the lobby was a happening place and very relaxing to kick it and watch sports. Nice place.
