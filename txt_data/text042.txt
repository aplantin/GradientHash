Go-to meal: cheddar butter burger, fried cheese curds, and flavor of the day custard. The difference between a deluxe burger and cheddar butter burger is that in the deluxe, you'll get American cheese.  And you have to pay 25 cents extra to add lettuce, tomato, etc. to the cheddar butter burger.  File that away in your memory bank.
