Such a cute place!! I was there for breakfast, and had eggs, bacon, homefries, toast and a pancake. I like variety, what can I say?? Eggs were good. Bacon and toast ok. Homefries were kinda greasy, but tasted awesome. Totally looked like they would be gross, but were delicious. Pancake is where it's at. Seriously. Just perfect.  Also, I believe they make their own pastries. Several coffee options, too.  The outside seating is so cute, too. I was there on a weekday morning, so there wasn't a whole lot going on, but it was still fun to sit outside on a perfect day, and watch the traffic and people go by.
