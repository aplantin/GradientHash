Only stayed two nights but would be very comfortable with a much longer stay.  We had a 2-bedroom suite and it was HU-uge!  Two masters, I initially took the one closer to the front door before realizing I'd given the kids the king bed.  Mommy don't play that.  I made everyone switch.  Three tvs.  Two ironing boards and irons.  Kitchenette. The layout and amenities was very much like a Residence Inn but maybe a (small) notch cheaper. The pool/hot tub was really nice.  Indoors, clean and completely empty AND open 24 hours!  Who does that?  It's completely separate from the other buildings, so we didn't feel bad when we were having chicken fights at 11:30 pm our first night (jet lag, ya know).  When we checked in we were told many of the guests were "transplants" so we'd most likely have the pool and hot tub to ourselves.  Which made me ask, why would people relocating to the area not want to use the pool?  Doh!  She meant literally transplant PATIENTS at Univ. Hospital or the VA.  I guess I went blond for the weekend...On the map, you'd think there would be major freeway noise as this hotel seriously couldn't get any closer to the beltline.  We heard absolutely nothing.  Either there's good soundproofing or they shut the highway down at midnight.  Also no noise from other rooms. Decent standard buffet breakfast.  Sunday paper had no funnies... Did they take 'em out or don't they do that in Wisconsin??  I would totally stay here again.
