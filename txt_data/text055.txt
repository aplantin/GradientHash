Californians are all about the In-N-Out, where you can get your burger animal style. And the Midwest is all about Culver's, where the Butter Burger is the thing to order. C. and I ate lunch here on our way between Milwaukee and Mosinee before going to my folks for Christmas. I got a cheddar burger with fries, and C. got the two-piece chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans. That's one of the things I love about Culver's. Yes, it's a fast food restaurant. But they also do family restaurant food well. The chicken was good and the green beans really fresh, C. said. Fast food you can feel good about. I also got a frozen custard, their flavor of the day: Swiss almond Christmas or something like that. Chocolate custard with slivered almonds. Yummo.
