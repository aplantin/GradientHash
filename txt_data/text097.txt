Nice atmosphere. Like an upscale Starbucks. We ordered coffee, chai, a breakfast sandwich and quiche of the day. Was told drinks would be out in a few minutes but food would take 40 minutes. Don't know if its always like that or if they were just short staffed. But seriously 40 min for a slice of quiche and a breakfast sandwich? We told them just make the drinks, forget the food. Even so the drinks took 11 minutes. This place has potential but a wait like that is crazy. Would not recommend until they work their production issues out. One star. Disappointed.
